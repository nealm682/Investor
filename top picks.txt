From the Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
Revenue Growth: Consistently increasing sales (the "top line") indicates market demand and a growing business.
Profit Margins: Calculating the gross, operating, and net profit margins helps assess how efficiently a company manages its production costs and overall expenses. Healthy, stable, or expanding margins often signal strong pricing power and effective management.
Earnings Per Share (EPS): This widely used metric shows how much profit is attributable to each share of stock. Investors look for consistent or growing EPS over time.
Quality of Earnings: Professionals look beyond the net income (the "bottom line") to ensure profits are derived from core, sustainable business operations, not one-off gains.
Expense Analysis: They analyze trends in operating and non-operating expenses to spot inefficiencies or unusual costs. 


From the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time (its assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity). Investors focus on: 
Liquidity: This assesses the company's ability to cover its short-term obligations. Key metrics include the Current Ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) and the Quick Ratio (current assets minus inventory, divided by current liabilities); a ratio above 1.0 or 2.0 is generally considered healthy.
Solvency/Leverage: This evaluates the company's long-term financial stability and reliance on debt. The Debt-to-Equity Ratio (total liabilities divided by shareholder equity) is a critical metric. A lower ratio generally indicates a more conservative and less risky financial structure, although acceptable levels vary by industry. The Interest Coverage Ratio (operating income divided by interest expense) helps determine if the company can easily make its annual interest payments.
Asset Utilization: Investors assess how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue, using metrics like the asset turnover ratio.
They carefully evaluate intangible assets like intellectual property and goodwill, which can significantly impact a company's book value and competitive advantage. 

Integrated Analysis & Key Ratios
Professional investors combine information from both statements, often with the cash flow statement, using techniques like: 
Trend Analysis: Comparing financial data over multiple periods to identify patterns, gauge the stability of margins, and make more reliable forecasts.
Benchmarking the company's ratios against those of its competitors and industry averages to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Valuation Ratios: Using metrics like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio to determine if the stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its earnings or book value.
Return on Equity (ROE): This key profitability metric shows how effectively a company utilizes shareholder equity to generate profit. A high ROE (often 10-20% is considered good, but this varies by sector) suggests strong management performance. 

Income Statement Red Flags
Declining or Inconsistent Revenue Trends: A consistent decline in revenue over several periods or unusual, unexplainable spikes can indicate weakening demand, loss of market share, or even revenue manipulation, such as recording sales before they are earned.
Net Income Consistently Exceeding Operating Cash Flow: This is a major red flag, suggesting that reported profits may not be backed by actual cash collection. It often points to aggressive accounting practices, like premature revenue recognition.
Shrinking Profit Margins: Consistently narrowing gross or operating margins indicate that costs are rising faster than sales prices, signaling potential operational inefficiencies, increased competition, or loss of pricing power.
Frequent "One-Time" or Non-Recurring Items: While these items (e.g., restructuring charges, asset impairments) are legitimate, their frequent or regular use to adjust non-GAAP earnings can be a tactic to mask ongoing operational weaknesses.
Expense Manipulation: Red flags include capitalizing normal operating costs (treating them as long-term investments), failing to write off obsolete inventory, or understating reserves for bad debts or warranty costs to boost reported profits. 
Balance Sheet Red Flags 
Accounts Receivable Growing Faster Than Sales: If the money owed by customers (accounts receivable) is growing disproportionately faster than actual sales, it suggests the company is having difficulty collecting payments or is using loose credit policies to inflate revenue.
Inventory Buildup: A significant increase in inventory levels relative to sales may indicate production issues, weak customer demand, or that the company is "channel stuffing" (pushing excess products onto distributors).
Excessive Debt Levels and High Debt-to-Equity Ratio: A persistently high debt-to-equity ratio, especially when compared to industry peers, can signal high financial risk and potential difficulty in meeting debt obligations.
Declining Liquidity Ratios: A current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) consistently below 1.0 or a low quick ratio suggests the company might struggle to meet its short-term financial obligations with its readily available assets.
Large "Other" or Unexplained Assets/Liabilities: Vague or oversized line items in the "other assets" or "other liabilities" categories might be a "dumping ground" for questionable adjustments or hidden obligations that lack transparency.
Negative Shareholders' Equity: This indicates that total liabilities exceed total assets, which is often a sign of severe financial trouble or potential bankruptcy risk. 
General and Accounting Red Flags
Discrepancies Between Financial Statements: Inconsistencies across the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement can signal errors or potential manipulation.
Frequent Changes in Accounting Policies or Auditors: Sudden, unexplained shifts in accounting methods make it difficult to compare performance across periods and may be an attempt to obscure financial results. Similarly, frequent auditor turnover can suggest disputes over accounting practices.
Significant Off-Balance Sheet Items: A high reliance on off-balance sheet financing or obligations can hide the true extent of a company's liabilities.
